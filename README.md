# WForecast
 
 Application is made using Kotlin, livedata, data binding, room database, coroutines, mvvm pattern.
 
## Bonus tasks completed:
1. Forecast data is cached, important for providing smooth user experience for the
   moments when the internet connection is not available.
2. Fragment transitions are animated, using simple slide-in slide-out animation, animation 
   in reasonable amounts adds a feeling of real interaction and responsiveness, improving overall UX.
3. Weather conditions are represented by matching icons, displaying information as icons or
   pictures makes app easier to localize.
4. On the location weather screen average temperature for the day is calculated and displayed
   as words. Displaying information in such way makes it harder to localize.
